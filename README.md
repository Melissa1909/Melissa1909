## Hi there âœ¨ðŸŒ™

My name is Melissa and I am currently a PhD candidate at the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.mh.tum.de/mh/startseite/), where I specialize in neurodevelopmental disorders. With a high enthusiasm for neuroimaging and data science, my research focuses on the inter-individual heterogeneity and molecular underpinnings of schizophrenia and prematurity. 

I also aim at advancing open science and quality of education. I have therefore compiled a bunch of resources as a starter pack to dive into neuroimaging research and programming. [Check it out](https://github.com/Melissa1909/neuroimaging-primer)!

Feel free to drop me a line on LinkedIn if you want to connect!
